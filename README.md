# Autotuning
Self-tuning of load balancing based on CSA algorithm. Compatible with shared memory systems

# Description
**Autotuning** is an adaptation of the Coupled Simulated Anneling optimization method in a load balancing self-tuning context. Its cost function is the value of chunksize, its cost being the execution time. The tool can help in the parallel optimization of algorithms that run in shared memory systems.
